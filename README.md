# Groot Translator app

A fun translation app made in Html and CSS using a Minion API - https://funtranslations.com/groot

It converts the user input into a Groot version of that text as an output.

While doing this project I get to learn:

1. how API's work
2. how server work
3. how to use postman to test a query
